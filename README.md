It contains about 4,000 TOEFL-focused words, making it possible to study efficiently while enjoying the process like a game.

## Linked to TOEFL Score Levels

#### Vocabulary is divided into levels that correspond to approximate TOEFL score ranges:

- Level 1 & 2 → Basic vocabulary for learners aiming at TOEFL 60–70.

With the filter button, you can select your target level and study step by step according to your personal goals.
